        Achieving a healthy weight promotes overall health and well-being. However, for some individuals, traditional methods of diet and exercise may not be sufficient to achieve significant weight loss. In such cases, weight loss surgery, also known as bariatric surgery, has emerged as one of the most effective surgical methods for Obesity and a range of its health impacts.

          To start treatment, our surgeons access the tumor directly by FNAC or perform needle biopsy under image guidance for tissue diagnosis. This gives biological knowledge and correct staging of the disease. Complete staging helps to plan further treatment and forecast expected outcomes and the overall result of treatment. A better understanding of tumor biology and revolutionary developments in radiation oncology and medical oncology have enabled a shift from radical surgery to lesser radical surgery with an emphasis on preserving organs, their good functioning, and post-operative morbidity. Our nutritionists, physiotherapists, and clinicians work together to support healing and improve quality of life.

          <p>Several types of surgery are helpful to people with cancer. Some surgeries are used in combination with other types of treatment. Types of surgeries include:</p>

        <div>
          <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold m-2'>Curative surgery</h3>
          <p>Curative surgery removes the cancerous tumor or growth from the body. It is done when the cancerous tumor is localized to a specific area of the body. This type of treatment is often considered the primary treatment. However, other types of cancer treatments, such as radiation, may be used before or after the surgery.</p>

        <div>
          <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold m-2'>Preventive surgery</h3>
          <p>Preventive surgery is used to remove tissue that does not contain cancerous cells, but may develop into a malignant tumor. For example, polyps in the colon may be considered precancerous tissue and preventative surgery may be performed to remove them. </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold m-2'>Diagnostic surgery</h3>
          <p>Diagnostic surgery helps to determine whether cells are cancerous. Diagnostic surgery is used to remove a tissue sample for testing and evaluation (in a laboratory by a pathologist). The tissue samples help to confirm a diagnosis, identify the type of cancer, or determine the stage of the cancer.</p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold m-2'>Staging surgery</h3>
          <p>Staging surgery works to uncover the extent of cancer, or the extent of the disease in the body. Laparoscopy (a viewing tube with a lens or camera is inserted through a small incision to examine the inside of the body and to remove tissue samples) is an example of a surgical staging procedure. </p>

          <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold m-2'>Debulking surgery</h3>
          <p>Debulking surgery removes a portion, though not all, of a cancerous tumor. It is used in certain situations when removing an entire tumor may cause damage to an organ or the body. Other types of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy and radiation, may be used after debulking surgery is performed.</p>
